## 📋 Overview

This project implements a machine learning-based system for detecting faults in sensors. It analyzes sensor data to identify anomalies and potential failures, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing downtime in industrial environments.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In industrial settings, sensor faults can lead to equipment damage, production losses, and safety hazards. Traditional threshold-based detection methods often fail to identify subtle patterns that precede failures. This project uses advanced machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in sensor readings before they lead to critical failures.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** (89.4%): Core implementation of data processing, machine learning models, and analysis
- **HTML/CSS** (10.6%): Web interface for visualizing sensor data and detection results

### Libraries and Frameworks
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Flask/Django (for web interface)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
- PyTorch/TensorFlow (for deep learning models, if applicable)
